Non Profit Organizations can take up a lot of space and power in a community and it is essential to recognize that and find ways to distribute that power back to community members.</p>
                                    <p class="tx-md-4 text-white mb-4">For this reason, Planting Seeds programs are decided upon with community members through Community Meetings and Interviews. In addition, all programs are facilitated by community members, and we have a community collaborative that helps us lead community meetings, fundraise for the center and make important decisions about the future of the center.</p>
